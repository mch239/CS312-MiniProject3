So, I started over from the beginning. Following the instructor's guidance of 
starting with the authentication page. May be turning this in late but I am going
to try my best. 

@2pm, have the server running. 
@3pm, have the register button working and credentials showing up in PGadmin DB table.
    - have the blog homepage from MP1 showing up after registering new user. 
@4pm, found the syntax error for the login on index.js. Whoops. No errors on console.log
